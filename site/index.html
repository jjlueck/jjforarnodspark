            <h2>Common Sense for Arnolds Park</h2>
            <p>As a community of 1200 residents, our voices should be heard. I believe in a common-sense approach to city government, where your input directly shapes our priorities. Through community surveys and open dialogue, we can ensure that our city council focuses on what truly matters to you.</p>
